Hi, I'm Hendrik and I'm a addict.

Idea: narcissist in hall of mirrors
my mind immediately went to Doom (1992)
Engine with unlimited mirrors.
Can I build it in a game jam?

I wanted to use no AI in this jam.
Started with `vim`, and typing.
Fast switched to an IDE with "old style" code completion (no AI)
Tried to look up "how to" on search: AI preview in my face.

On Saturday, under the shower, I knew what the game should be.
I thought of it IN SPECS
Not IN CODE

Hello Darkness my Old Friend

If you believe that a thing should exist,
You're obliged to push what you're willing to do
To make it exist

Our time on this planet is limited.
A game jam is time-limited.

But I know I cannot go back to the time before.
Let all hope go, ye who enter here.
Read the classics.
